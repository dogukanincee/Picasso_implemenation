# Picasso Implementation with RecyclerView in Android

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates how to use the Picasso library and RecyclerView to load and display multiple images from the same URL in an Android app.

----------
Features
----------

Loads and displays multiple images from the same URL using Picasso library
Displays the images in a RecyclerView with a custom adapter
Uses placeholder and error images to handle loading and loading failure
Loads images asynchronously using Picasso's Target interface

----------
Dependencies
----------

Picasso - a powerful image downloading and caching library for Android

----------
Usage
----------
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
The app should display 10 images in a RecyclerView, with each image loaded from the same URL using Picasso. 
Placeholder and error images are displayed if an image fails to load or is still loading.

Implementation Details
----------

MainActivity

The MainActivity is the main entry point of the app. It sets up the RecyclerView with a LinearLayoutManager and an instance of the ImageAdapter. 
It also calls the loadImagesUsingPicasso function, which loads 10 images from the same URL using Picasso.

ImageAdapter

The ImageAdapter is a custom adapter for the RecyclerView. It manages a list of images that have been loaded and provides a ViewHolder for each image.
The addImage function is used to add a new image to the list and update the RecyclerView. 
The onCreateViewHolder function inflates the image_item layout and returns a new instance of the ImageViewHolder. 
The onBindViewHolder function binds an image to the ImageViewHolder by calling its bind function.

ImageViewHolder

The ImageViewHolder is a ViewHolder for each image in the RecyclerView. 
It manages an instance of the ImageView and provides a bind function that loads an image into the ImageView.

loadImagesUsingPicasso

The loadImagesUsingPicasso function is responsible for loading the images using the Picasso library. 
It loops through 10 image URLs and loads each image asynchronously using Picasso's Target interface. 
When an image is loaded, it creates a new ImageView, sets the bitmap on the ImageView, and adds the ImageView to the ImageAdapter. 
If an error occurs during loading, a placeholder or error image is displayed.

Conclusion
----------
This project demonstrates how to use the Picasso library and RecyclerView to load and display multiple images from the same URL in an Android app. 
The code is well-organized and easy to follow, making it a great starting point for your own projects that require loading and displaying images.
